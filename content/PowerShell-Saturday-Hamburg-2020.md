## Intro

Since May 2018, [Fabian](https://twitter.com/fabian_bader) and [I](https://twitter.com/chrburmeister) run the [Hamburg PowerShell User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Hamburg-PowerShell-User-Group) once a month and for the first time, we organized an entire day of PowerShell Magic.

## Speaker, Sessions and Workshops

This Speaker Lineup speaks for itself, for me, is's still unbelievable.

[Fabian](https://twitter.com/fabian_bader) and I would like to thank all Speakers for coming to Hamburg and sharing their Knowledge!

### Content

The Presentations will be available in the next days - I will update the table above as soon as possible.

## Sponsors

Without our Sponsors, this Event would not have been possible. We would like to sent a big THANK YOU to [QSC AG](https://www.qsc.de/de/), [Aequitas Integration GmbH](https://aequitas-integration.de/) and [Visorian GmbH](https://www.visorian.com).

## Thank You All
I'm actually shocked by the fact, that so many people came to Hamburg from so many different places - Rob flew in from the UK, Mathias from Amsterdam, Tobias and Holger from Hannover, Evgenij from Berlin, but also the Attendees were not just from Hamburg, we had people drive up from Dresden, Stuttgart, Berlin, Rostock, Braunschweig and even some that flew in from Switzerland and Austria - incredible! We really appreciate every single one of you!
A special thanks goes to [SÃ¶nke](https://twitter.com/groove64) for helping us throughout the entire planning phase of the event as well as for being there the entire day - we cannot thank you enough!

See you all at next years PowerShell Saturday in Hamburg!
