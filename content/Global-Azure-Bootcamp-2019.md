Once every year, all the worldwide Azure communities come together to the Global Azure Bootcamp. This year on April 27th it's the sixth time and we are proud to be part of it the fourth time in a row!

Each user group will organize their own Global Azure Bootcamp and we will be hosting the one in Hamburg, Germany. Like every year, it will take place at the Microsoft Office in Hamburg (Gasstraße 6a).
It is completely free and if you want to sign up, just go ahead and register on our [event page](https://eventleaf.com/gab19) or at our [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Global-Azure-Bootcamp-2019-Hamburg/).

After organizing this event for three year, I want to thank all prior Sponsors and
